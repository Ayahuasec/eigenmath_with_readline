\section{Tricks}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
In a script, line breaking is allowed provided the line breaks occur immediately after operators.
The scanner will automatically go to the next line after an operator.

\item
Setting \verb$trace=1$ in a script causes each line to be printed just before it is evaluated.
This is useful for debugging.

\item
The last result is stored in the symbol \verb$last$.

\item
Use \verb$contract(A)$ to get the mathematical trace of matrix \verb$A$.

\item
Use \verb$binding(s)$ to get the unevaluated binding of symbol \verb$s$.

\item
Use \verb$s=quote(s)$ to clear symbol \verb$s$.

\item
Use \verb$float(pi)$ to get the floating point value of $\pi$.

\item
Assign strings to unit names so they are printed normally.
For example, setting \verb$meter="meter"$ causes the symbol {\it meter}
to be printed as \verb$meter$ instead of $m_{eter}$.

\item
Use \verb$expsin$ and \verb$expcos$ instead of \verb$sin$ and \verb$cos$.
Trigonometric simplifications occur automatically when exponentials are used.
