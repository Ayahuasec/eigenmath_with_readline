A quantum computer can be simulated by applying rotations to a
unit vector
$u\in\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$ where $n$ is the number of qubits.
For example, four qubits would have $u\in\mathbb{C}^{16}$.
The dimension is $2^n$ because a register with $n$ qubits
has $2^n$ eigenstates.
Quantum operations are ``rotations'' because they preserve $|u|=1$.

\bigskip
\noindent
The Eigenmath function
$rotate(u,s,k,\ldots)$ rotates vector $u$ by rotation code
$s,k$ where $s$ is an upper case letter and $k$ is a qubit index.
Index numbering starts at zero and counts up to $n-1$.
Multiple rotation codes can be specified
and are evaluated from left to right.

\bigskip
\noindent
The following table summarizes the available rotation codes.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$C,k$ & Control prefix
\\
$H,k$ & Hadamard
\\
$P,k,\phi$ & Phase modifier
\\
$Q,k$ & Quantum Fourier transform
\\
$V,k$ & Inverse quantum Fourier transform
\\
$W,k,j$ & Swap bits
\\
$X,k$ & Pauli X
\\
$Y,k$ & Pauli Y
\\
$Z,k$ & Pauli Z
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent
Control prefix $C,k$ modifies the next rotation code so that it
is a controlled rotation where $k$ is the controlling qubit.
The Fourier transforms $Q,k$ and $V,k$ are applied to bits $0\ldots k$.
Also, $Q$ and $V$ ignore any control prefix.

\bigskip

Error codes
\begin{itemize}
\item[1] Argument $u$ is not a vector or does not have $2^n$ elements where $n=1,2,\ldots,15$.
\item[2] Unexpected end of argument list (i.e., missing argument).
\item[3] Bit number format error or range error.
\item[4] Unknown rotation code.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent
Eigenstates $|j\rangle$ are represented by the following vectors.
(Each vector has $2^n$ elements.)
\begin{align*}
&|0\rangle=(1,0,0,\dots,0)
\\
&|1\rangle=(0,1,0,\ldots,0)
\\
&|2\rangle=(0,0,1,\ldots,0)
\\
&\vdots
\\
&|2^n-1\rangle=(0,0,0,\ldots,1)
\end{align*}

\noindent
A quantum computing algorithm is a sequence of rotations
applied to the initial state $|0\rangle$.
(Mathematically, the sequence can be collapsed into a single rotation.)
Let $\psi$ be the final state of the quantum computer
after all the rotations have been applied.
Like any other state, $\psi$ is a linear combination of eigenstates.
\begin{equation*}
\psi=\sum_{j=0}^{2^n-1}c_j|j\rangle,\quad|\psi|=1
\end{equation*}
The final step is to measure $\psi$ which will
change it to an eigenstate $|j\rangle$ with
probability
\begin{equation*}
P_j=c_jc_j^*
\end{equation*}
The output from a real quantum computer is always an eigenstate.
In general we cannot measure the $c_j$'s directly.
However, we can run the same calculation multiple times
to obtain a probability distribution.
From the probability distribution we can estimate
$c_jc_j^*$ for each eigenstate.

\bigskip
\noindent
In Eigenmath, the probability distribution can be computed as follows.
\begin{center}
\tt P = psi conj(psi)
\end{center}

\noindent
Hence
\begin{align*}
&\text{\tt P[1]}=\text{probability that $|0\rangle$ will be the result}
\\
&\text{\tt P[2]}=\text{probability that $|1\rangle$ will be the result}
\\
&\vdots
\\
&\text{etc.}
\end{align*}

\noindent
