"I have often felt that programming is an art form,
 whose real value can only be appreciated
 by another versed in the same arcane art;
 there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
 hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,
 by the very nature of the process."

 Ed Nather, The Story of Mel
