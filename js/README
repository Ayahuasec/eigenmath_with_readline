Result is eigenmath.js

See demo.html for a template web page that uses eigenmath.js



Differences from original Eigenmath:

1. Big integers are not supported.

   Rational numbers a/b are supported if both a and b are less than 10^15.

   Otherwise, conversion to floating point occurs automatically.

2. The following functions are not supported:

besselj
binomial
ceiling
